<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

This project is developed by FCI Team. It is a framework for iOS platform to integrate with FPT.AI Livechat service.
<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
* Xcode 13.3 and above
* Cocoapod v1.11.3
* A physical iOS device
* An Apple developer account
### Notes
* Sample project is provided in the <b>BangiaoFramework.zip</b> file. Please unzip it and open the project with Xcode.
* The file <b>fptchatbotsdk.zip</b> contains the framework and the necessary files to integrate with the project. Please unzip it and follow the instructions below to integrate the framework into your project. This file is xcframework, which is compatible with both simulator and real device, to deliver for customers.
### Integrate framework
* Please contact FCI to obtain the SDK and other necessary information.

* Install

1. To integrate the eKYC into your Xcode project using CocoaPods, specify it in your Podfile:

```sh
pod 'fptaichatbotsdk', :path => "./"
```
Replace the temporary path with the path that you place unzipped fptaichatbotsdk framework.
The folder structure should look like this:
```
/ <<< root project
/ Podfile . In fptaichatbotsdk.zip has a sample Podfile.
/ fptaichatbotsdk
    / fptaichatbotsdk.bundle
    / fptaichatbotsdk.podspec
    / fptaichatbotsdk.xcframework
```


> Relative paths can be used. In case you put the framework in the same directory as the Podfile, the above declaration is correct.

2. Install the pod into your project by typing in terminal:

```sh
pod install
```

* requires following keys in Info.plist:

```
<key>NSPhotoLibraryAddUsageDescription</key>
<string>Photo Library Access Warning</string>
<key>NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription</key>
<string>Photo Library Access Warning</string>
```

3. Add the following code to your ViewController file:

* Usage
```
let config = FChatBotConfig(
    senderName: "",
    senderID: "",
    token: "",
    botCode: "FPT provided bot code",
    extraInfo: "{\"phone_number\":\"...\"}",
)
FChatBot.startFPTChatbot(withConfig: config, from: self) { result in
    print(result)
}
```

In which:
- botCode: is the specific bot code provided by FPT.AI.
- senderName: is the name of client.
- senderID: is the unique string which should be provided from client.
- token: is the token provided by FCI to a third party.

* Note: If you want to fix client information.
* Please use the following code:
```
let config = FChatBotConfig(
    senderName: "Your client name. Ex: Nguyễn Văn A",
    senderID: "Generated by client . Ex: UUID",
    token: "Token provided by call API",
    botCode: "FPT provided bot code",
    extraInfo: "{\"phone_number\":\"84977444555\"}",
)
FChatBot.startFPTChatbot(withConfig: config, from: self) { result in
    print(result)
}
```
